# Thunderstore

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/risk-of-thunder/Thunderstore/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/risk-of-thunder/Thunderstore)

Thunderstore is a mod database and API for downloading Risk of Rain 2 mods.

## Setup guide for development

-   Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and modify as you see fit
-   Run `docker-compose up`
-   Run `docker-compose exec django python manage.py migrate` in another terminal

You will also need to navigate to the admin panel (`/djangoadmin`)
and configure a mapping from a site to a community. You can create a superuser
account with the `createsuperuser` Django management command (akin to how
migrate was run) to gain access to the admin panel.

To connect a site to a community, you will need to:

1. Make sure at least one Community object exists or create one
   (`Risk of Rain 2` should be created automatically)
2. Make sure at least one Site object exists or create one
3. Make the site object's `domain name` attribute match what you use for
   connecting to your development environment
4. Create a new Community Site object, linking the two together

## Mod package format

Mod packages are `.zip` files, with at least the following contents:

-   `/icon.png` - A PNG icon for the mod, must be 256x256 resolution.
-   `/README.md` - A readme file to be rendered on the mod's page.
-   `/manifest.json` - A `.json` file with the mod's metadata. Required filds are:
    -   `name` - Name of the mod. Allowed characters: `a-z A-Z 0-9 _`. No spaces.
    -   `description` - A short description of the mod, shown on the mod list. Max
        250 characters
    -   `website_url` - URL of the mod's website (e.g. GitHub repo). Can be empty,
        but the key must still exists (use an empty string for example).
    -   `version_number` - Version number of the mod, following the semantic version
        format `Major.Minor.Patch`. For example: `1.3.2`.

Example `manifest.json` contents:

```json
{
    "name": "TestMod",
    "version_number": "1.1.0",
    "website_url": "https://github.com/risk-of-thunder",
    "description": "This is a description for a mod. Max length is 250 characters"
}
```

## REST API docs

The REST API swagger documentation can be viewed from `/api/docs/`.

At the current moment, the only relevant API is `/api/v1/package/`, which lists
all the active mods in the database. A specific mod can also be fetched if
necessary with the `/api/v1/package/{uuid4}/` endpoint, where `{uuid4}` is
replaced with the mod's uuid4 value.

## Admin site

The admin site can be accessed from `/djangoadmin/`. To view the admin site, you
need an admin account.

Assuming docker is being used, the admin account can be created as follows:

```
docker-compose exec django python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Do note that if you're running on Windows, you will need to use winpty for
running that command.

## Environment variable configuration for production

### General variables

-   `DEBUG`: Should be either set to false or not at all for production
-   `SECRET_KEY`: A long and random string, used to hash passwords and other data.
    Should remain secret, as is implied by the name.
-   `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Comma separated list of hostnames this server can be
    connected with. For example `beta.thunderstore.io`
-   `SERVER_NAME`: The public name of the server, such as
    `beta.thunderstore.io`
-   `PROTOCOL`: The protocol which to use to build URLs to the server. Either
    `https://` or `http://`.

### Gunicorn

-   `GUNICORN_WORKER_COUNT`: Used to control how many workers gunicorn will spawn
-   `GUNICORN_LOG_LEVEL`: Used to control gunicorn's logging level

### GitHub OAuth

To set up GitHub OAuth, head to settings on GitHub (either personal or
organization settings), and from under `Developer Settings` select `OAuth Apps`.

Create a new OAuth Application, and use `{server}/auth/complete/github/` as the
Authorization callback URL, where `{server}` is replaced with the protocol and
server name that is accessible. For example for local you could use
`http://localhost/auth/complete/github/`, whereas for a live environment
`https://beta.thunderstore.io/auth/complete/github/`

After creating the OAuth application, you must also provide the following
environment variables to the application:

-   `SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_KEY`: The `Client ID` value of the OAuth application
-   `SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` The `Client Secret` value of the OAuth application

### Discord OAuth

To set up a Discord OAuth, head to the Discord developer panel, and create a new
OAuth application. Add a callback URL to `{server}/auth/complete/discord/`,
where `{server}` is replaced with the protocol and server name that is
accessible. For example for local you could use
`http://localhost/auth/complete/discord/`, whereas for a live environment
`https://beta.thunderstore.io/auth/complete/discord/`

-   `SOCIAL_AUTH_DISCORD_KEY`: The `Client ID` value of the OAuth application
-   `SOCIAL_AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET` The `Client Secret` value of the OAuth
    application

### Google Cloud Media Storage

You need to set up a google cloud storage bucket and create a service account
that has access to the storage bucket.

Set the following variables:

-   `GS_BUCKET_NAME`: The name/id of the storage bucket
-   `GS_PROJECT_ID`: The ID of the project the bucket resides in
-   `GS_LOCATION`: The subfolder under which the files should be stored in the
    bucket. Can be left empty or undefined.
-   `GS_CREDENTIALS`: Base64 encoded (with no newlines) string of the service
    account credentials json file, that can be downloaded from google cloud console.

_NOTE: Google Cloud Storage is currently configured to only store package icons_

### Backblaze B2 Media Storage

You need to set up a backblaze b2 account (and bucket) and create an auth key
with access to it correspondingly.

Set the following variables:

-   `B2_KEY_ID`: The id of the auth key
-   `B2_KEY`: The auth key secret
-   `B2_BUCKET_ID`: Backblaze b2 bucket ID
-   `B2_LOCATION`: Location inside the bucket where to upload files
-   `B2_FILE_OVERWRITE`: Allow file overwriting. True is recommended, backblaze b2
    retains all file versions regardless.

_NOTE: Backblaze B2 is currently configured to only store package zips_

### AWS S3 and other Boto3 compatible storages

The AWS S3 / Boto3 protocol is supported by multiple vendors and services, and
such the implementation may vary depending on the provider.

Refer to
https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html for
more details on the implementation. Also see
[thunderstore/core/settings.py](web/thunderstore/core/settings.py) for what environment variables are
currently implemented.

At the very least set the following variables:

-   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Auth key ID
-   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Auth key secret
-   `AWS_S3_REGION_NAME`: Storage bucket region
-   `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL`: Storage service endpoint
-   `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`: Bucket name
-   `AWS_LOCATION`: Location inside the bucket where to upload files

_NOTE: Enabling AWS S3 will currently override all other cloud storages and
will be used for all media storage_

### Database

Database configuration is pretty straight forward if using a local database
where no SSL is required, but remote database via SSL connections is also
supported.

-   `DATABASE_URL`: The database URL to use for a database connection
-   `DB_CLIENT_CERT`: Base64 encoded client certificate to use for the database
    connection. Will be placed to `client-cert.pem`
-   `DB_CLIENT_KEY`: Base64 encoded client key to use for the database connection.
    Will be placed to `client-key.pem`
-   `DB_SERVER_CA`: Base64 encoded server CA to use for the database connection.
    Will be placed to `server-ca.pem`

### Redis caching

You can enable caching to the redis backend by supplying a redis URL

-   `REDIS_URL`: The redis database URL to use for caching, e.g.
    `redis://some-host:6379/0`
